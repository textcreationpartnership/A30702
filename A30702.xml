            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

O! the howl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and orying, and gnaſhing of teeth there, where mercy is not to be found, in the grant of one drop of water on the fingers <hi>tip to cool the tongue.</hi> There the day of patience is no more, to
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:108574:11"/> wait upon the ſinner, as here, with a <hi>when ſhall it once be?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 13.27.</note> And <hi>How long? Jer.</hi> 31.22. But Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice is then let looſe, and at large with the ſcourge of wrath, to revenge the quarrel of abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed mercy, and to vindicate the glory of a deſpiſed Covenant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That out of Hell there is no delivery; no redemption from this grave. The condition, into which man enters, when launching out of this world into the depth of eternity, whether of weal, or woe, it is a fixed ſtate; there is no change thereof. A delivery from torments (the portion of the damned) is not to be expected: neither is a plucking out of <hi>Abraham</hi>'s bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom, or the Fathers hand, (the inheritance of the faithful) to be feared, <hi>John</hi> 10.29.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> The Voice of God in the Scriptures, and by his Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers is now to be hearkened, and attended to in this preſent life, in order to the life to come:
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:108574:12"/> the which if it be neglected by us, there is no expecting Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritions from the dead to call us to repentance: which (if yet they were to be had) would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs prove ineffectual to that end; if the witneſs of God in his Word be not embraced by us. The Word of God is of more efficacy to work upon, and convert the heart, than if one ſhould ariſe from the dead to Preach unto us. It is God's Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, and hath the vertue of a Divine Inſtitution for ſuch an end going with it. Whereas for the dead to ariſe, and ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, there is no ſuch Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; the which if it were mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculouſly granted upon tryal, yet it would not avail; for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly our Saviour tells us, That, <hi>if we hear not</hi> Moſes, <hi>and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, neither would we be perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded though one roſe from the dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There are divers other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars that lie ſententiouſly couched in, and which the parts

They lye down in care, their reſt is in unreſt, ſleep de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts from their eyes; they are fraughted with fears, toſſed with contrivances, hang in ſuſpence and doubt; fear to looſe, care to keep, and contrivances how to encreaſe and augment their Worldly Good is the whole that is acted on the ſtage of their lives. And will not all this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly imbitter their enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? The truth is, all the good things wicked men do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, will <hi>ſcarce anſwer the charge,</hi> they will not (as we may ſay) <hi>bear charges;</hi> There is ſo much of trouble and cumber they meet withall here in this World with their Portion, that the <hi>play is not worth their candle:</hi> And if ſo, where then lies their Treaſure? we do not account that as any part of our treaſure, which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for ſpending money by the way.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> There's a <hi>mixture of grief and anguiſh</hi> in and with the Worldly Good of the wicked. They meet with manifold croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and invincible diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in their way; their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns are fruſtrated, purpoſes are broken off, and their intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments fail: and they being void of thoſe Graces and Spiritual Endowments, which alone ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with content to undergo croſs occurrences, hence they are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed, <hi>and ſtumble, and fall; and are broken, and ſnared, and taken.</hi> Iſa. 8.15.

<pb n="154" facs="tcp:108574:86"/> what humility means: neither can they undergo their diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments contentedly,<note place="margin">

                        </gap>ave not learned the way of true contentment.</hi> And ſo they lye o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to all that grief and anguiſh which any way can be occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from affliction without; or that can ſeize upon a Soul that's void of a Work of true Grace (for ſo their's is) within. The felicity of the wicked is not therefore to be the Object of any your envy, neither is their State deſireable. Will you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy them the enjoyment of that which is interlarded with ſo much anguiſh as imbitters all the ſweet and pleaſure; or deſire that State wherewith you muſt have more gall than gain, more grief than glory? oh, the many <hi>Thornes and Briers that are with them,</hi> I mean the cares and cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber: and they <hi>dwell amongſt Scorpions,</hi> in the midſt of grief and anguiſh. Now there being ſuch a mixture as this in all they
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:108574:86"/> have, ſurely their Portion is very poor in the Earth, and in their greateſt fulneſs they can never be accounted truely happy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There's a <hi>mixture of ſin and guilt.</hi> The worſt of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils is intermedled with the beſt good things the wicked do en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy. Sin it is the worſt of evils, becauſe the cauſe of all, and ſting of all. There's nothing properly that can be denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted evil, but ſo far as ſin is in it, and in its reſpect to ſin. There's ſin and guilt in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyments of the wicked: though the gifts of God are good in themſelves conſidered, and as from him; yet ſo far as their hand, as to acquiſition, is found therein, there is a ſtreak that goes along. They get and heap together, but they heed not how; they encreaſe, but it's that which is not theirs; they enrich themſelves,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hab.</hi> 2.9.</note> but it's by violence; and <hi>the ſpoil of the poor is in their houſes.</hi> Iſa. 3.14. <hi>They
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:108574:87"/> covet an evil coveteouſneſs to their houſe, that they may ſet their neſt on high, that they may be delivered from the power of evil: and they ſin againſt their own Soul.</hi> Hab. 2.9, 10. All their work is to <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfill the luſt thereof.</hi> Rom. 13.14. They proceed from evil to evil, and in their beſt enjoyments corrupt themſelves. Idolatry is all their worſhip, and their luſt it is their Idol; <hi>their God is their belly.</hi> Phil. 3.19. And as they get by wrong, ſo they do not uſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; the end of mercies is not aim'd at, much leſs anſwered by them; but all is perverted ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way, ſo that <hi>their courſe is evil,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and their f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>rce not right.</hi> And is not here a ſtream of guilt going with them all along? So that let the whole of their race and way be remarked from their firſt entry upon their portion, to the time of their cloſe and parting with it, and you find ſin and guilt ſtill to attend, ſo
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:108574:87"/> as every day adds new ſin to the old guilt, to the filling up the meaſure of their ſin, till they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come out of meaſure ſinfull. Surely their condition muſt needs be very miſerable, when their Portion has ſin thus for it's ſoul and ferment.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> There's a mixture of <hi>curſe and vengeance</hi> in the good things of the wicked. The curſe runs along with all their enjoyments; though the bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs thereof may not be felt at preſent, yet it is gone out, and ſhall ſeize at length. A Portion full of deadly Poyſon drunk off may not preſently work, ſo as in the very inſtant of its reception to put forth its venom, but by and by it does appear. Suppoſe a man have a Son that Marries richly, he gets an Heir that is a very rich match, and he has a large Portion with her, and you go and fetch away the baggs of Gold and Silver that are her Portion, and he huggs himſelf in
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:108574:88"/> his rich fortune, but if it ſhould prove that every bagg of Gold you have of your Wives Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſhould have the plague in it, it were but a poor Portion. Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly thus it is with all ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ones in the World, that whatſoever they do enjoy, let their comforts be never ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull, and their enjoyments never ſo lovely, all the while they live, and continue wicked, they have the curſe of God that goes along, and makes way for their eternal miſery. As true believers have a bleſſing of God in outward things, that lead the way of their eternal good unto them. So the wicked and impenitent have the curſe of God mingled with a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>THe fifth particular propoſed in the entrance upon this point, and for carrying on the diſcourſe, was to endeavour to <hi>mark out (ſo far as may be) who that man or woman is, that in ſuch a condition is like to have all their Good things in this preſent World.</hi> For every one is apt to put it off from themſelves, and to ſhift the charge (whilſt in general) upon another. Every one is ready to go away and ſay, I hope it is not I, I hope that God hath a better Portion for me. We are unwilling to look upon our ſelves as the perſons in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to be concerned, if the thing ſpoken of be repreſented as evil,
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:108574:100"/> or under the face of danger. Fain would we catch at what is good as belonging to us, though we have no Title to it: and loth are we to apply unto our ſelves the evil, as having nothing to do therewith, though the thing it ſelf do immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern us. And therefore as a narrow, impartial ſearch into the ſtate of our hearts and waies, is our undoubted duty: ſo help for the carrying on this ſearch, and the diſcovery of our ſtate cannot be but exceeding uſefull. Now let us endeavour to enquire and ſearch out, who that man or woman is that is like to have all his, or her Good in this preſent World: that, living and dying in ſuch a condition, as I am now about to ſpeak of; in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent condition wherein he is, if there be not a ſaving change wrought upon him, is certainly the man, to whom the Lord pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounceth it this day, that his Portion is in this preſent World. Now who is he?</p>

                     <hi>Eighthly,</hi> Conſider what it is thou doeſt admire moſt men for, and for which thou lookeſt upon them as happy. Is it becauſe ſuch a man hath ſo much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mings in by the year; ſuch poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, houſes, furniture; ſuch goods, ſhop, trading; ſuch cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, eſteem, and repute in the World, that therefore thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counteſt him as happy? Or he's a man of great intereſt, power and authority; he is alſo to doe; what not? and therefore thou doeſt admire him? Never weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him in the ballance of the Sanctuary, nor conſidering, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no there be a work of
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:108574:114"/> Grace upon his Heart, which is the only thing truly valuable; but overlooking this accounteſt him happy for his Worldly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and enjoyments. This is an argument that thou art in the dark as to the true ſpiritual ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to this very time. Perhaps the men thou doeſt admire upon theſe accounts are vile perſons, being void of Grace, and the true ſaving knowledge of God in Chriſt, and yet thou doeſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mire them. Art thou not car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall? Is not the World thy God? Doeſt thou not herein ſhew thy ſelf like unto them, and one of them? Otherwiſe, thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not admire them thus, as hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py? and upon meer Worldly accounts call them bleſſed? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly God ſpeaks exceeding contemptibly of all ungodly ones in the World: though they be never ſo great in regard of out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, and admired in the eyes of men; yet, if they be ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they are contemptible in his

<pb n="225" facs="tcp:108574:121"/> but how fares it with thy ſoul all the while? Alas, it's poor, and lean, and thin, and bare: thy body's in good likeing, but there's <hi>leaneſs ſent into thy ſoul,</hi> Pſal. 106.15. It's worſe with thee now than it was formerly.

The more thou haſt the worſe thou art grown. This is a ſign, that together with thy Portion, thou haſt the curſe of God along upon thee. And if ſo, thou art the man, that is likely to have all thy good things here. He for whom

For all condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of themſelves are equally inſufficient for the production of any ſpiritual good, without the concurrence of Gods grace and bleſſing with them. Now this argues ſomething of good reſerved in ſtore for us for the time to come, where the bleſſing of God is upon us in our enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments here, keeping us low, humble, holy, and ſelf denying.

As if a man ſhould eat meat at ones table, and as ſoon as he hath eaten it, begin to ſwell, he will conclude certainly the meat was poyſoned: So when thy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate riſes, and thy heart riſeth in pride together with it, ſurely thy corruption poyſoneth thy eſtate unto thee; and inſtead of a bleſſing, thou haſt the curſe of God upon it.

                     <hi>Twelfthly,</hi> Whether hath God convinced thee of that which ſtops the great current of his mercy, and of the right way to have it opened? What it is that laies (as it were) a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint,
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:108574:123"/> and why, upon the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of his choice mercies; and how that reſtraint is to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved? If the choice mercies in Chriſt be deſigned for thy portion; this he has, or will certainly convince thee of. Now that which ſtops the great current of Gods choice mercies is, Divine Juſtice: and this by reaſon of our ſin. So that untill Divine Juſtice be ſatisfied, and ſin removed, and taken away, the great current of Gods choice mercies cannot be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But now the Lord Chriſt the Son of God, and Second Perſon in the Bleſſed Trinity he is come into the World, and by his Bleſſed Mediation for us, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfies Divine Juſtice, and is that <hi>Lamb of God,</hi>

Doeſt thou ſee that wide breach which thy ſins have made between God and thee, and which by no other means can be made up, but only by the Mediation of the Son of God? And art thou convinced that the current of Gods Eternal Mercies can flow out no other way towards thee, but only through the Golden Pipe of the Lord Chriſt's Mediation? And therefore, thou ſayeſt, Lord it is not from any righteouſneſs of mine, nor from any thing that any Creature in Heaven or Earth can do, that I expect to have my Portion, but through the Mediation of the Son of God. That's the thing I look
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:108574:124"/> after, my heart cloſes with that Mediation, I looked upon that as the mean of all my worth, and of the conveyance of all my mercies. If it be thus with thee, then here's the man indeed, that is not like to have his good things in this World. He looks for other gueſs mercies from the Mediation of Chriſt, than any this World can afford; and in due time ſhall have them. But now the man that has his Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in this World, looks no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther but to Gods general boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: never conſiders what ſtops the great current of Gods Grace; is not convinced of the indiſpenſable perfection of Gods Juſtice, nor of that infinite breach which ſin as made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and Man; is not ſenſible of the abſolute need there is of Chriſt, and of his ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction unto Divine Juſtice: and ſo to pant after Chriſt for relief and ſuccour, through whom alone he may enjoy the
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:108574:124"/> pardon of his ſin, and have the Conduit of Gods choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies opened. No, theſe are all as Ridles to him, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtands not what they mean; all he looks after, is ſome overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Gods General bounty here in this World towards him, in the enjoyment whereof (had he 'em but) he could ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curely acquieſce, and ſing a <hi>requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>em</hi> to his Soul, <hi>now Soul, take thine eaſe:</hi> as if his Soul were no other than of a brute. This now is the man that is like to have all his good things here. For thoſe to whom God gives Eternal Mercies, he convinces them of the evil of their ſin, of that infinite breach that ſin has made between God and their Souls, and how that no Creature in Heaven or in Earth could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie Divine Juſtice, and make up that breach, and open the current of Gods Eternal Grace, but only the Lord Chriſt muſt come, through whom alone
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:108574:125"/> there is Peace and Reconcilati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to be enjoyed: and ſo lets them ſee their abſolute need of Chriſt for Salvation, and ſtirs up all the powers of their Souls to breath after him, and Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal mercies in him. Now if it be not thus with thee, that God has not cauſed this Conviction-work to paſs upon thy Soul, and enlarged thy heart after theſe things, through which he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries on his People to a full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of himſelf in Glory; but thou ſitteſt down under the ſhade of Gods general bounty, and ſo makeſt to thy ſelf a fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaf covering and there takeſt up thy reſt; know that the iſſues of Gods general bounty are like to be thy Portion, and thou haſt all thy good things here.</p>

It is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly a Moral Precept to Honour God with our Goods, and by bringing Preſents to him. Seeing theſe holy men
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:108574:134"/> thought it fit to grant God ſo liberal a Portion, why ſhould not we think him worthy as much, or that ſomething muſt be due to God, and that in a liberal quantity?

We have ſeen, that there is a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men to whom God grants the enjoyment of ſome good things only in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent life, which ended, after that they ſhall never have more. Here's their all of good that ever they are like to enjoy.

<pb n="253" facs="tcp:108574:135"/> a large Dole of good things to the wicked in this life. And moreover have ſeen, that all the good things they do enjoy, are confined to this preſent life; ſo as when this life ends, all their good is at an end. We have alſo look'd into the miſerable Condition of ſuch men, who have all their good things here; and have endeavoured to mark out, ſo far, as we may, who that Man or Woman is, that in ſuch a condition is like to have all their Good Things in this preſent World.

                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> If there be a Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of men who have all their good in this preſent World, then hence we may gather the reaſon why the men of the World are ſo cunning in the things of this World. Why they can make ſo good ſhift for themſelves rather than other men can. They are ſubtill, and crafty in and about their World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerns; <hi>they ſeek deep to hide their Counſell,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 29.15.</note> 
                     <hi>and their works are in the dark.</hi> Why, this is the reaſon; Here's their Portion: their very happineſs, and all their good is here. No marvail then though they make ſuch ſhift in the World as they do. Will not all the powers and faculties of the Soul be active, and diligent to get and preſerve that wherein happineſs is preſented as conſiſting, and which accordingly is apprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:108574:136"/> by them? This puts the men of the World upon their ſhifts, and makes them ſo active and cunning about their Portion. <hi>The Children of this World</hi> are wiſe in their Generation,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.8.</note> yea <hi>wiſer</hi> (ſaith our Saviour) <hi>than the Children of Light.</hi> They have a notable Serpentine Wiſdom, they know how to gather and heap together, they are inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſubtil myſtery of over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching and circumventing:<note place="margin">Hab. 2.6.</note> they know how to encreaſe that which is not their own, and with an indiſcernable cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to carry it on; beguileing ſilly Souls ſometimes by ſerious Proteſtations, ſometimes by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and ſeemingly real Promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; vailing ſometimes their unworthy actions under a Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard and Colour of Religion, that they may with leſs remorſe of Conſcience, and more juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably (if poſſible) before the World, <hi>devour widows Houſes.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 23.14</note> Much of the Serpents wiſdom
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:108574:137"/> may be ſeen put forth in the men of the World, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably they act it as his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Now the Apoſtle ſaies on the other hand, 1 Cor. 2.12. <hi>We have not received the Spirit of the World.</hi> We cannot tell how to ſhift in the World, as the men of the World do: we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not cheat, deceive, and couzen as they do. We look further then theſe Earthly things, and ſo cannot ſhift as other men can. We have not the Spirit of the World, as they, who have their Portion in this World, and ſo cannot uſe their cunning: we are led by another Spirit, and guided up to another Portion, and have our ſenſes exerciſed about other Objccts, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore cannot act in their way. The men of the World (you know) are compared to Swine in Scripture,<note place="margin">Mat. 7.6. Luk. 15.4.</note> and the children of God to ſheep: Now a Swine though it goes abroad all day long wandring up and down, it

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Not only the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but the probability may much prevail with you. For on Gods part it ſeemeth more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable thou mayeſt enjoy an Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Good, than Millions in the World. For howſoever many men by abuſe of the means, may make their condition far worſe than that of <hi>Heathens</hi> and <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans:</hi> yet if we ſpeak ſtrictly in reſpect of the means themſelves, it is far more probable thou that haſt the means, ſhouldeſt enjoy an Eternal Good, rather than thoſe that enjoy them not. The greateſt part of the World ſits in horrible darkneſs without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny light: to them the Word hath not come, the light of the
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:108574:161"/> Goſpell revealing an Eternal Good hath not ſhined forth; ſo that on Gods part, and the means, it is far more likely that God wills thy enjoyment of an Eternall Portion of Good, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than thoſe to whom he ſends no Prophets at all. It is true, the Word is ſometimes ſent to harden men, and it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the Savour of Death; but this is after men have horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly abuſed it: and it is not the proper and genuine effect of the Word, but accidentall through the Indiſpoſition and Obſtinacy of the hearers. Then, only it is, that God ſayes, <hi>Go and make the Heart of this People fat, and make their ears heavy, and ſhut their eyes,</hi> Iſa. 6.10. Well then, let this conſideration encourage you to put on for an Eternal Good: God hath not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, or denied the means to thee; yet he ſends his Prophets, and Miniſters to call thee to him: Why doth God Vouchſafe all
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:108574:161"/> this to me? Who ſhould awake and bethink themſelves if I do not? Who ſhould put on for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>WE have divers Arguments to ſtir us up to put on for an Eternal Portion, and to lift up our heads, and look beyond preſent things. The door by which an Entrance is to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of an eternal Good, ſtands open for all Commers who have an heart to enter There is as fair a way for the pooreſt ſort who have but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Portion in this World, to have the God of Heaven and Earth to be their Portion: to have whatſoever <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> hath Purchaſed by his <hi>Blood,</hi> to be their Portion; to have Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and Eternity, and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality to be their Portion; as there is for the Greateſt Poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in the World. Many poor people are ready to ſay, Alas,

My Father is dead, and hath left me no Portion, and my Friends they are poor, and thoſe few of them that are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, they overlook me. I, but for all this, you may come to have a Portion: It's poſſible ſome poor Wretches may have a Portion in God, and Chriſt, and Immortality, as well as the greateſt and richeſt of all. Raiſe up therefore your hearts, you that are poor and mean; and know, that you are born for high things: How meanly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you live now, you may be glorious Creatures hereafter, if ſo be you have an heart to put upon it, and to ſeek after this Eternal Portion. But now, you'l all ſay, Lord, what ſhould we do, that our Portion may be an higher Portion, and our
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:108574:171"/> Good a more choice Good, than this World is able to vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafe unto us? Oh, ſays the rich man, that's truly and throughly convinced of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of all Worldly Good, as to Eternal Satisfaction (for though it's hard for ſuch to be convinc'd, yet not impoſſible, and with God moſt eaſie) What ſhall I do, that I may enjoy this bleſſed Portion? And ſays the poor man, Sith it's poſſible for the pooreſt and meaneſt Wret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches to have an Intereſt in this Eternal Good, I am reſolved to caſt in my Lot, and what ſhall I do? Now the Directions that I would lay before you (ſome whereof may ſuit all ſorts, and all of them one or other) are theſe that follow.</p>

Whereas the eye of Faith can look upon them as already expiring, and through them look upon him, who there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore gives the Creatures unto us, that in them we might ſee his Power, and taſte his Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. And nature it ſelf me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks may ſeem to have intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome ſuch thing as this in the very order of the Creatures: downwards a mans eye hath ſomething immediately to fix on, all is ſhut up in darkneſs ſave the very ſurface, to note, that we

All the beauty and all the fruit of the Earth is placed on the very out-ſide of it, to ſhew how ſhort and narrow our affections ſhould be towards it. But upward the eye finds ſcarce any thing to bound it; all is tranſparent and diaphanous, to note how vaſt our affections ſhould be towards God, how endleſs our thoughts and deſires of his Kingdom, how preſent to our Faith the Heavenly things ſhould be even at the greateſt diſtance.

And therefore though

Pray that the Lord would give you the true ſenſe and underſtanding of this Text, that you may know and inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly digeſt the meaning of it, and find that vertue in it, as may

                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let the whole courſe of your life be carried on in the fear of God, and thence ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a fear, leſt that here ſhould be the <hi>All,</hi> that ever you are like to enjoy. As this was made uſe of as a ſign before, ſo now as a means. Let the whole courſe of your life be ſteer'd (as it were) with the fear of God, leſt that God ſhould put you off with preſent things. Think oftentimes with your ſelves, what if I ſhould never enjoy more good, than here I have, and that with this preſent life all my good ſhould end? Should God now this night take me away out of the Land of the living, and give me my Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the Infernal Pit of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, what would all the good of this preſent life avail me?
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:108574:184"/> Had it not been infinitly better that I had never known it, nor enjoyed it, than thus to be put off with it; and for a few tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitory hours of fading comforts, now to lye howling under the juſtly deſerved wrath of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite God in paines unſuffera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all Eternity? Often do you meditate and think upon the conditions of thoſe, how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely forlorn they are, to whom it falls out to be their lot to have all their good things here. Think with your ſelves, that though they now abound in all wealth and ſtore, yet you even ſee them <hi>on ſlippery ground,</hi> Pſal. 73.18, when all their good and jolly thoughts ſhall periſh, and they never like to enjoy good hereafter any more. Let the courſe of your life be ſeaſoned with ſuch thoughts as theſe. And eſpecially you that have great Portions in this World, and you know that hitherto you have done God, his Church, or
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:108574:185"/> People, little or no ſervice; you have not ſerved him in the abundance and fulneſs you do enjoy. You know there are many poor People that live upon Almes have done God more ſervice, and have contributed more to the Honour of his name, than you have done with all your wealth in all your dayes. Oh, you have great cauſe to fear, leſt you be the perſons who may take up with this World, and for whom there's no good reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the World to come.

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:108574:185"/> they are liable to a great deal of temptations, and to aſſaults that are much more furious and violent to the carrying them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, than others are, who want thoſe Worldly Comforts and advantages which they do enjoy. And our Saviour Chriſt tells us, that a man who has a great Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this World, though it's poſſible he may have more here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, yet it's hardly, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.23, 24.

                     <note place="margin">Luk. 1.74, 75.</note> Our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt, <hi>though he were a Son, yet</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>he learned Obedience; and being made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect is become the Author of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation to all them that obey him,</hi> Heb. 5.8, 9. Service here goes before the reward hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, though the <hi>reward is not rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned of Debt, but of Grace:</hi> for when <hi>we have done all thoſe things that are commanded us</hi> (were that poſſible, or within our compaſs) yet <hi>we are unprofitable Servants, and have done but that which was our duty to doe,</hi> Luk. 17.10. Now if you expect choice mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, let your ſervices be choice ſervices; ſuch as in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure may aim at an Heavenly Portion. Let your ſervices, as on the one hand influenced on
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:108574:191"/> by, ſo on the other be tendent to the <hi>Grace</hi> of Eternal Life. How ſhould your ſervices be ſeaſoned with Faith, and Fear, and Self-denyal? How ſhould they be ſprinkled with the ſalt of the Graces of Gods Spirit? If you expect, and move towards an Eternal Portion; how ſerious and earneſt, how real and inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ſhould your thoughts be, and the workings of your affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in and about your ſervices? Let your deſigns in your duties be Heavenly, if you deſign the <hi>Inheritance of the Saints in Light.</hi> See to the choiceneſs of your Services in their Principle, end, and manner. A Supernaturall Principle is requiſite to a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Work. Thoſe Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which are congenite, and naturally inbred, will not enable to the performance of a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall Work:<note place="margin">Joh. 3.6.</note> For that <hi>which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh; but that which is born of the Spirit, is Spirit.</hi> Grace it is a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:108574:192"/> Principle, and works beyond what conviction merely is able to raiſe one to, it brings a ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ableneſs between the Work and the Heart, to which otherwiſe the Heart will not be enclined, but naturally is averſe and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſed. Hence all that enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in Souls that are in the ſtate of unregeneracy to the things of God; they cannot away with Gods Service and Worſhip, the Work of God it is a burden to them, they cannot bear it; they complain under it, as irkſome, tedious, wearyſome: ſaying with thoſe the Prophet menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>When will the New Moon be gone,</hi>

And ſo the end muſt be ſuitable too, or elſe the Service will not find acceptance. The end has a
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:108574:192"/> great Influence upon the Work to render it acceptable, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected: if the end and aim be towards God, to Honour him, in Obedience to him, to fulfill his Will, to pleaſe him, to teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy our Submiſſion to, and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon him, our thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for mercies received, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits conferred, and our truſt in him: thus the end's good, and will ſo far dignifie and put a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon the Work. But if the end and aim be towards our ſelves, as our own praiſe, Self-eſteem, Worldly credit, if it be to Honour our ſelves, by ſeeking to <hi>receive Honour one of another:</hi> Joh. 5.44. If the aim be at our profit, advancement, or advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in this World, it is a poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to our ſervices; and of ſuch Our Saviour Chriſt ſays, <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, they have their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Mat. 6.2.5.16. They have what they aim at, and they have it <hi>now.</hi> And we are to ſee that our Services be Choice in
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:108574:193"/> their manner too. The moda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Act, as well as the matter, and end thereof, is duly to be conſidered: Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces are to be weighed, not only the <hi>bonum</hi> but the <hi>benè</hi> is to be regarded. <hi>Seneca,</hi> in giving of his rule, how to know the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, when they are naturall, and when not, ſaith he, you ſhall know a natural affection by this, <hi>if it be kept within bounds, it is na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural; if it be out of bounds, it is not natural.</hi> I'le make uſe of it in another way, when you come to the Service of God, if you think to limit God in his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; you will go ſo far, as may be conſiſtent perhaps with eaſe, or profit, or credit, and there ſtop, this is but a natural Service. But if the Service be Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, you will let out your Hearts (if it were poſſible) Infinitly to God. You will propound no bounds, no limits to your Ser<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vice. And this is indeed the truth of Grace, when it hath
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:108574:193"/> the impreſſion of Gods Infinit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon it: that the Soul ſets no limits, nor bounds in the way of Grace, but deſires to anſwer God (if it were poſſible) by an infinite way: as he is without all bounds and limits, ſo the Soul would ſet no bounds nor limits to Grace in Service. This is a Choice Service, in a Supernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral way.</p>

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:108574:203"/> with the love of life, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man'd with the fear of death, or entangling himſelf with the things and cares of this preſent world. So we find the Apoſtles phraſe, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.4. <hi>No man that warreth entangleth himſelf with the affairs of this life, that he may pleaſe him, who hath choſen him to be a Souldier.</hi> So a Chriſtian that has a noble aim, no leſs than at Eternity, Life, and Glory; and who accordingly eſtimates the things aimed at, will not ſurely be remiſs in the diligent uſe and improvement of all good means, ſuitable to, and appointed for the effecting of his aim. The end will put him upon the means; and the more excellent the end is in his eye, ſo much the more diligently will he intend the means. Now an heavenly Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, an everlaſting Inheritance the good things of Eternity, the excellency of their Name points at their Worth, ſo as no end can be more glorious: and therefore
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:108574:203"/> this muſt needs ſpirit to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention upon the means. Who can think to attain the end of a Journey, which he never entred upon, nor, in order to it ſet a foot i'th way? or if he have entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the way, yet ſhall linger there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, and make no riddance? Or ſhall, after ſome progreſs therein made, turn again out of it? Can this man hope to attain his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys end? ſurely no. The ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of means in affairs natural or moral, and yet a diſcourſing of the end, argues the folly and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of ſuch Pretenders: and much more are ſuch pretenſions not only vain, but dangerous, when the Concerns are ſpiritual to which they are referred. Do you look for a Portion, an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and therefore an high, full, and laſting; then apply your ſelves to the means conducent to the obtaining of it. Truly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, of the Lord Chriſt tendred in the Goſpel; give up your ſelves unto him; live the life of
